Dear Community Leader,
Our company started over 40 years ago as a community newspaper and
gradually focused on managing print advertising in partnership with
newspapers throughout New Jersey. As we know, newspapers across the
country have been going out of print, such as our former partner, the Star
Ledger. While we understand most people getting their news instantly on
their mobile devices, our communities are losing something: the traditional
local paper with local content. Major state and national news are easily
accessible, but the events and activities in your community are not.
Beginning this September, we will introduce Community Observer, a weekly
community newspaper with stories about your community, many submitted
by YOU! What’s happening in local youth sports? What events are coming
up in my community? What organizations have activities in my town? Are
there events and activities for seniors near me? How can I let my neighbors
know about my event or major accomplishment? What is my town council
working on to improve my community?
Community Observer will be a weekly, 8-page, print newspaper delivered to
the residents of your community by newspaper carriers. Included in
Community Observer will be valuable information on sale pricing and
coupons from local businesses. Our paper will be a one-stop destination for
news about what’s happening in your community and opportunities to save
on groceries, dining out, and other activities near you.
Local newspapers are an American tradition, and we are excited to bring
them back in your community! For more information on submission of
photos and articles or delivery information, please visit
thecommunityobserver.com or email us at info@mycommunityobserver.com.
We look forward to being a valuable part of your community!
Sincerely,
Jim Knoll, Senior Vice President
