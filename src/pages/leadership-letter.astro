            Our company started over 40 years ago as a community newspaper and gradually focused on managing print advertising in partnership with newspapers throughout New Jersey. As we know, newspapers across the country have been going out of print, such as our former partner, the Star Ledger. While we understand most people getting their news instantly on their mobile devices, our communities are losing something: the traditional local paper with local content. Major state and national news are easily accessible, but the events and activities in your community are not.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-brand-gray mb-6">
            Beginning this September, we will introduce Community Observer, a weekly community newspaper with stories about your community, many submitted by YOU! What's happening in local youth sports? What events are coming up in my community? What organizations have activities in my town? Are there events and activities for seniors near me? How can I let my neighbors know about my event or major accomplishment? What is my town council working on to improve my community?
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-brand-gray mb-6">
            Community Observer will be a weekly, 8-page, print newspaper delivered to the residents of your community by newspaper carriers. Included in Community Observer will be valuable information on sale pricing and coupons from local businesses. Our paper will be a one-stop destination for news about what's happening in your community and opportunities to save on groceries, dining out, and other activities near you.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-brand-gray mb-6">
            Local newspapers are an American tradition, and we are excited to bring them back in your community! For more information on submission of photos and articles or delivery information, please visit thecommunityobserver.com or email us at info@mycommunityobserver.com.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-brand-gray mb-8">
            We look forward to being a valuable part of your community!
